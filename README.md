# Operating-System-CSE316
This Project is Based on Priority Scheduling Algo and Based on C++ Language.


#Question:- Design a scheduler that uses a preemptive priority scheduling algorithm based on dynamically changing priority.
           Larger number for priority indicates higher priority. 
When the process waits for CPU in the ready queue (but not yet started execution),its priority changes at a rate n=2. 
All the processes are initially assigned priority value of 0 when they enter ready queue for the first time . 
The time slice for each process is q = 1. 
Calculate the average waiting time for each process.
The program must be generic i.e. number of processes, their burst time and arrival time must be entered by user.

This Project Contains Algo of Priority Scheduling and Round Robin in C++ Language.
And the Combine and final project is in File named as "New Full Project".
